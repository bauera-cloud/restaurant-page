project goal: practice ES6 Modules and Webpack

plan: 

goal for today: 
    make and style menu page
    make sure the menu link works




Other option:
homepage.js etc. uses the partials, add div to content
if user clicks menu link in the nav bar, delete div from content, add menu div to content

if user clicks menu
    content.removeChild()
    content.appendChild(menuContent) //menuContent is the div (that includes partials) from menu.js
